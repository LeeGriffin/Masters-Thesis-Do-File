Masters Thesis Do File
Hello! I am new to github and to be honest, am not sure how all of this works
but I have uploaded the do file from my masters thesis and I guess if someone 
is using stata, they might find a useful command or somthing 
The most useful bits might be the 2 stage GMM models or the compression of 
my data to make 5 year panels

Other Notes: The "Base Dataset" is the QOG Standard Dataset 2017 from the Quality of Government Institute
I cannot upload anything over 25MB so I have included the final data sets (which is alot smaller) that can be used in the regressions
