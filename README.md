Masters Thesis Do File
Hello! I am new to github and to be honest, am not sure how all of this works
but I have uploaded the do file from my masters thesis and I guess if someone 
is using stata, they might find a useful command or somthing 
The most useful bits might be the 2 stage GMM models or the compression of 
my data to make 5 year panels
